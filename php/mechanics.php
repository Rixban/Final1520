$title = "<h1>Mechanics</h1>";

$first = "<p>Mechanics... arguably the most important skill asset in League of Legends. This ranges from the basics of CS'ing (Last hitting minions), to positioning in lane, to your personal skill level with the champion you are using. Being proficient at these is important if you wish to reach the promise lands of Diamond and above, so we shall cover each briefly before tying everything together.</p>";

$firstHeader = "<h2>Last Hitting</h2>";

$cs = "<p>This is the primary way that you earn gold, and the faster you earn gold, the faster you can buy your items, get your powerspikes, and have a larger impact on the game. I've seen people rise at least a whole division just by practicing this simple mechanic. Your goal as a laner that isn't support, is to average about 10cs per minute. Now to put that into context, you should be at 100 cs at 11 minutes or so, but this is unrealistic for every game.</p>";

$muCS = "<p>Match-ups will dictate the way you play your lane, and what CS you are able to get, and what CS you aren't able to get without giving something up in return. But on average, the average amount of CS per minute raises drastically between divisions that have at least one division between them (Bronze to Gold, Silver to Plat, Gold to Diamond, Plat to Masters/Challenger). The overall stats from an entire game however, is a bit more skewed as Challengers only seem to average 2-3 more cs/min than Bronze. If you look at the first ten minutes though, Bronze players average anywhere between 30-60 CS, while Challengers range between usually 80-100. That's a huge difference considering for the first twenty minutes, the avergage gold of a wave is 118.33 (counting siege minion waves). So that 40+ cs difference nets to about at least extra 840 gold in the first ten minutes.</p>";

$endcs = '<p>That number is quite large, and if two players of equal skill were put up against each other with that difference, the person with the cs lead would have more items and should win any trade with their opponent. This is easily the most important basic mechanic to learn and practice, and most CS that players will miss is within the first 5 minutes of the game, followed by the first 10 minutes of the game.</p>';

$practice = '<p>So you may be asking yourself, "What can I do to improve my CS?" and this goes for every elo up to about Diamond where players should be more than comfortable getting any free CS. Here are different ways to improve your CS through practice.</p>';

$steps = array("Go into a Custom Game, all by yourself and pick whatever champion you main or a champion in the role you main, and just CS for 10 minutes. Check your CS at 5 minutes, you should aim for at least 40 CS at 5 minutes, and then keep farming until 10 where you should at least be at 90 CS or so. This means you should have gotten roughly 95% of the CS that came into lane.","Once you've successfully been able to get 95% of the CS at least TWO private matches in a row, move onto the next practice. This time around, start up a private match, and alternate between pushing the wave as fast as you can while getting CS, and only last hitting. You should aim for the same amount of CS as before, roughly 95%. The degree of difficulty increases a lot in this step. Aim for at least two games in a row of success.","Finally, add a bot into your lane, and focus on CS'ing and learning how to position and harass in lane. You should NEVER push the bot out of lane, do not allow them to get below 50% health. This will teach you your ranges of your abilities, the ranges of the opponent, and will help you CS with someone against you in your lane. Again, aim for at least 2 games in a row of success, alternating between only last hitting, and pushing lane as hard as you can.");
		
$endpractice = "<p>This practice can take a lot of time, when I did it myself, it took me roughly 7 hours of practice to complete this regiment, mostly because of the multiple game clauses. After that you should see a major improvement in your last hitting ability. Now take those skills and try them out in a normal game. I recommend doing this with champions you are likely to play, and not ones that you will not play. You can learn how to CS with them later when you understand the mechanics a bit better.</p>";
	
$video = '<p>Here is a video not by me of the process and what to do in each step: <links> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xfmm40Ow-T8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>';

$picture = '<p>To the right is a chart of the amount of CS encountered in lane for the first 30 minutes</p> <br /> <center><img src="images/cs.png" alt="CS Chart"></center>';
$secondHeader = "<h2>Positioning</h2>";
	
$positioning = "<p>Positioning yourself in lane is.... a bit of practice to say the least. The most optimal positioning changes every second in a game, which is why it can be hard to master this mechanic. Positioning is also about understanding your Champion, their strengths and weaknesses, as well as their match-ups. This one is a bit harder to practice, but what you want to do is imagine a circle around your champion and that is their range. That range fluxuates with abilities, so it's important to always know the range of everything on your champions kit. However you also need to imagine a circle around the enemy champion/s, and their ranges. If at any time the ranges overlap, that means that either they are able to hit you, or you are able to hit them. This is trading or harasing in lane. Your goal is to try to position yourself to either harass the enemy champion when they go to CS or if they're out of position in lane, OR to safely CS and minimize their chance of harassing you for free. Giving up CS to harass is rarely a good idea unless you're able to get a kill for it.</p>";
	
$trainPos = "<p>Training positioning is not something that is easy to do, as you have to learn every champ match-up for your champion, and then understand when the enemy can go in, and when you can go in. Cooldowns are important to keep note of, if some ability is down and that makes their range circle go down, this is your time to CS or to go in and trade if it is likely to come out in your favor. Always time any summoners like flash, or ignite in chat, or at least let it be known in the chat that the enemy champion used their summoner spells.</p>";
	
$practicePos = "<p>To practice positioning, honestly, just comes with experience, and leads into our next topic, Champion mechanics, but know that generally, <i>NOBODY</i> positions well until at least mid to high plat, when people <b>FINALLY UNDERSTAND</b> this mechanic.</p>";

$thirdHeader = "<h2>Champion Mechanics</h2>";
	
$introMU = "<p>Out of the three of these, this is what will allow you to beat higher skilled players or pull off those crazy plays that'll have everyone in the game going insane. Champion mechanics include your match-up knowledge, strengths and weaknesses, and how efficiently you use the champion.</p>";
	
$lowMU = "<p>At a low elo level, (Bronze - Gold) it is best to avoid any champion with really high skill cap like Zed, Azir, Lee Sin, LeBlanc, etc. and stick to easier champions with lower skillcaps like Tryndamere, Volibear, Annie, Amumu, Warwick, etc. This will allow you to climb easier because the champions are easy to use, and while they may not be the biggest playmakers, you should be able to out CS, and outplay easier because you'll understand the full potential of the champion is a shorter amount of time.</p>";
	
$aa = "<p>Animation cancelling is using either your abilities, auto attacks, or movement to shorten the time of your character animations in order to get the most damage out in the shortest amount of time. To figure this out for your champion, either auto attack and see what abilities you can cancel your auto attack into, or use an ability and see if you can chain it with other abilities or even your auto attack immediately. Some champions like Riven let you cancel her animations of her q by walking immeditely, or by using item actives like Ravenous Hydra. The key to this is experimenting, and practicing what you find out!</p>";
	
$muMechanics = "<p>Match-ups are also part of champion mechanics, and if you're good in that match-up, even if it's one your champion doesn't win often, your ability with your champion will dictate if you can turn the tides in your favor, or at least give you the ability to outscale the other team by playing safe and knowing what you can and cannot do. Looking up guides online (preferably find people who are diamond and above) on sites like LolKing.com and watching videos of Challenger players or pro players playing your champion will teach you how to farm in lane, how to look for trades, as well as teach you other lane mechanics like positioning, and team fighting. The information you gain from watching other people play will add a new layer of understanding of your champion, and what you need to do to be successful with them.</p>";
