Watch videos on them, understand their strengths and weaknesses, and know their match-ups well. Know what you can win, what you can't win, and how you can possibly outplay. Some deaths are unavoidable, but there are times you can turn a 1v2 into a double kill for you if you play it right. Don't get frustrated. Understand you can comeback any time in low elo, people throw... HARD.</p>";
